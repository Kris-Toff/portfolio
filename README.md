## About Me ##

Hi, my name is Kristoffer Jimenez I am 27 years old and I live on an island in Siquijor Philippines.

I am an IT graduate with a passion for web development and enjoy learning new technologies. I have 8 years of experience as a full-stack web developer using Laravel and Vue.js.

I started working after I graduated as a Magento developer, where I learned MVC and API integrations. The first web app I developed was a CMS for virgin coconut oils using Laravel framework and Bootstrap.

My recent job was at clickBACON Inc., I started as an assistant developer my responsibilities were developing new features, fixing bugs, database management, and API integrations. As time went on my responsibilities grew and I was tasked to revamp the whole frontend using Quasar a Vuejs framework, update our backend for API implementations, and map and extract data from Excel reports. My experience at clickBACON Inc. has built up my proficiency in cutting-edge technologies and allowed me to improve my communication skills, and build strong relationships with other developers.

In my spare time I play video games with my friends, I enjoy watching movies, TV shows, and anime. I love going to the beach fishing with my friends this helps me better handle stress. I enjoy the challenge of pushing myself physically so I got into marathons and participated in my first event last November 2024.
